# Functions

### Objective

In this project, our main goal is to understand how to use functions in C++.

### Problem

Develop a program that defines three functions to add numbers. 

### Implementation
- Write a function `addNumber` to add two integers.
- Write a function `addNumber` to add three integers.
- Write a function `addNumber` to add two doubles.
  
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    /*Call the functions here*/
    return 0;
}

```
